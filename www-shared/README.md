This is the platform-agnostic www folder - the contents of this folder can be copied to the native project's www folders.

We will use this for the second tab which will have a text field and a list. The third tab will be native and will also have a textfield and a list. The data is stored in a local variable in native code, so we need a plugin to `addToList` and `retrieveList` as well.
