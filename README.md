Embedding Cordova in a native app
---------------------------------
As demo'd by [Anis](https://github.com/imhotep) and [Eddy](https://github.com/eddyverbruggen) at PhoneGap Day EU 2016.

If you're looking for how to embed a webview in a native app then take a look at the steps and code in this repo. There are multiple ways to do it so don't take this one for granted, but we've done our best to make it as easy and relevant as possible.

For both platforms Anis (Android) and Eddy (iOS) split the effort in a number of logical steps. Each step also contains the resulting code (Xcode or Android Studio project) so if you get stuck you can simply download the result.

Happy coding!
