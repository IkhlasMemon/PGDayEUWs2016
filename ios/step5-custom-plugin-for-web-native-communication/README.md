Cordova iOS - step 5
====================
Adding a custom plugin for web-native communication

## Let's add a plugin
- TODO

Run the app and you shouldn't see anything different than the previous step, but this change gives us more control over how the webview is embedded, read on.. 

## Let's use the plugin
The plugin has two functions: `retrieveList` and `addToList`.
For both web and native we will create a view with an input field and a list and the idea is to sync those lists.

- Add a tab by opening `Main.storyboard` and dragging a `ViewController` onto the canvas
- Hold the `ctrl` key and drag from the 'Tab Bar Controller' to the new ViewController - that should add a new tab bar item

TODO ALL BELOW. The code is ready but it's a lot.. perhaps it's better to skip and download the result
